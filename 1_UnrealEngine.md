## Unreal Engine 4

### Downloading and Compiling

​	Now you need to download and compile the Unreal Engine 4. For better compatibility with CARLA we will use the 4.22 version.

​	Also we will use the directory `~/UnrealEngine_4.22` to install the engine.

​	First we download the 4.22 version from github to the  `~/UnrealEngine_4.22` folder.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 -b 4.22 https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine.git ~/UnrealEngine_4.22
```


​	Now we need to change to the installation folder: `cd ~/UnrealEngine_4.22 ` and compile.

```bash
./Setup.sh && ./GenerateProjectFiles.sh && make
```

### Setting the environment variable

​	Finally, in order for CARLA to know where is the UE4 installation we need to define environment variable `UE4_ROOT` with the correct directory. We can do this by editing the `~/.bashrc` file. You can use any editor, here we use nano.

```bash
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```

​	In the end of the file add the following line:

```bash
export UE4_ROOT=~/UnrealEngine_4.22
```

​	Now save and exit. To apply the changes run the command:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
